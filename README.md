# faceRecognition App

## You can access the site [HERE](https://nervous-bartik-6c47db.netlify.com/)

This app uses [Clarifai face detection model](https://clarifai.com/) to recognize and mark face of image you provide in the link-form.

Sign In form and Register are just placeholders, they have some basic back-end properties but are not working remotely.

This project uses [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) for simple and fast styling.

To try the project:

1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`

By default, a private API key is inserted, which should work just fine. In case of failure, try to replace it with your own Clarifai API key
